# CardVault

CardVault is a web application designed for trading card enthusiasts to easily manage and explore their card collections. Built with Blazor and Entity Framework Core, the app provides an intuitive interface for browsing, searching, filtering, and bookmarking cards. Users can organize their collections, quickly access details, and manage bookmarks within a dedicated section.

Key features include robust search and filter options, bookmark management, and pagination for smooth navigation. The application is responsive, ensuring a consistent experience across all devices. CardVault is ideal for both casual collectors and serious players looking to streamline their card collection management.

## Software Stack

CardVault is built using a modern and robust technology stack to ensure performance, scalability, and maintainability. The key technologies used in this project include:

- **Blazor**: A powerful framework from Microsoft that allows for the development of interactive web UIs using C#. Blazor is used to build the client-side components of the application, enabling a rich, single-page application (SPA) experience.

- **Entity Framework Core**: An open-source, lightweight, extensible, and cross-platform ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for .NET. Entity Framework Core is used to interact with the PostgreSQL database, allowing for seamless database operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.

- **PostgreSQL**: A highly stable and scalable open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). PostgreSQL is used to store and manage the card data, ensuring efficient and reliable data storage.

- **ASP.NET Core**: The underlying web framework that powers the server-side logic of the application. ASP.NET Core provides the infrastructure for handling HTTP requests, dependency injection, and other server-side operations.
